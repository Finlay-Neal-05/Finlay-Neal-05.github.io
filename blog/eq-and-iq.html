            <h4>EQ and IQ:</h4>
            <p>Emotional Intelligence is the concept of being able to understand ones own emotions, as well as the emotions of the others around oneself. It is the ability to observe without judgement ones own emotion. To be aware of ones emotion means that we can act with, rather than react to negative emotions within ourselves and others. Emotional Intelligence is a skill that is incredibly important when dealing with others, and when managing ones own life.

                EQ is different to IQ in that EQ is used to measure Emotional Intelligence and people skills. It measures how we act and react to our own emotions and those of others. It measures how we interact with the people around us, for example how we listen to them and how we communicate our own thoughts and feelings. IQ measures cognitive skills and recollection, it measures problem solving and knowledge retention. 
                
                EQ is important becuase it impacts how we live. It measures how to deal with the people around us, how we treat them and how we feel about ourselves. It is important because it helps us build strong relationships, as well as helping us to connect with our own feelings. It allows us to observe our feelings and take an action of our choice. I know from personal experience that there have been times in my life where emotion took over motion, and I acted in ways that I later regtretted. In that sense, being able to identify emotion and being able to rationally and calmly observe "how is this making me feel, and is my action driven by emotion?". These factors are incredibly important within our own lives, and are fundamental in building successful relationships, both professionally and personally.
