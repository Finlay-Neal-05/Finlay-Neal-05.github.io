                <li>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</li>
                <p>Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego due to the core learning is that I over estimate how hard something is and underestimate how capable I am of achieving the same task. My ego tells me I am less able to complete the task than I infact am.
                    another thing I learned about my ego during the core process is how I deal with problems, and problem solving. I have become alot more comfortable being stuck, and I have felt less offended by the idea of not being able to do something right away. Finally, I have learned what a growth mindset is, and that intelligence is not set in stone. 
                </p>
                <li>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</li>
                <p>The roles of values, empathy and self self-awareness in programming all apply when faced with a problem. Knowing how you respond to being stuck is very important when trying not to get emotionally lost in a problem. And knowing values and empathy are important when working with other people. Knowing how to empathise with the people around you, and knowing how to listen are both very important skills.</p>
                <li>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>
                <p>The thing that suprised me most about the core learning is about memorisation. What we did in the intro core work about memory and how it works, with neuron connections suprised me. Because I took some time to practice these methods it actually helped me recall more information, and retain more than I have previously been able to.</p>
                <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
                <p>The most challenging aspects of core learning was sticking to the habits we were trying to make. For example the commitments about taking time in the morning for self-awareness was difficult for me.</p>
                <li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</li>
                <p>Because in the coding space alot of work is collaborative. And knowing how to manage yourself, as well as how to go around with other people is an incredibly vital skill to have in the field. Knowing how to problem solve and work as a team is as valuable as knowing how to write a good loop. As well as this, knowing how to work with other people, and how to understand yourself are life skills that reach far beyond the field of programming. </p>
                <li>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead</li>
                <p>I don't think so at all. I really appreciated the things we learned. Like I said above I struggled to keep to my commitments about the self self-awareness practice, but it was also one of my favourite things that we did. I enjoyed all of the core work, and while I went through it much quicker than the programming, I don't think it was a waste of time. There is plenty more time in the day to practice programming if i'm really that fussed about it.</p>
