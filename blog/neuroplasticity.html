      <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
      <p>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity affects people because
        it shows them that "I can do it". It is the idea that our brains; and
        our intelligence, are malliable, and that with effort anyone can be
        'smart'. The principles of neuroplasticity are simple, the brain can
        re-wire itself, and it isn't rocket science either. Like highways, if
        more traffic makes the same trips, then clearly the roads must get
        bigger to accomodate. Your brain works the same way. If you think the
        same thoughts, are recall the same information repeatedly, the neural
        pathways in your brain will grow larger, like the highway. Outside of
        these commonplace scenarios, where neuroplasticity becomes even more
        beneficial, is when in individual recieves a serious injury. A stroke or
        traumatic brain injury survivor is able to rebuild he or her life
        because the brain is able to reshape itself, it is able to, in response
        to intrinsic stimuli, rebuild or reorganise its internal structure and
        connections. This allows those people to recover from injuries like that
        that would otherwise have massive affects on their lives. Studies show
        that children taught the principles of neuroplasticity, told that they
        can all be 'smart' performed better in school, on average, than the
        control group who were told that we are all 'born with a fixed
        intelliegence'. If you yourself wanted to engage with the principles of
        neuroplasticity, there are a few thnigs you can do: It can benefit your
        learning and your knowledge, as well as the way you see yourself. To
        engage with it you must challenge your brain, to stimulate the growth of
        neural pathways. One of the ways to increase neuroplasticity, from a
        useful resource I found is from
        <a
          href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/neuroplasticity-exercises#summary"
          >Medical news today</a
        >
        and it states that partaking in "activites such as making music or
        learning a second language may help improve your brains neuroplasticity"

      <h4>Growth mindset:</h4>
      <p>
        A growrth mindset is similar, and works arm in arm with neuroplasticity.
        A growth mindset is the idea than anyone and anything can be improved
        through dedication and hard work. It is the idea that like I discussed
        earlier, intelligence and ability are not set in stone, and that with
        work the brain can change and adjust to whatever is expected from it.
        Something that surpised me while I was researching a growth mindset is
        how relevant and important reflection is. I would think it a situation
        where improving and moving forward is the goal, slowing down and looking
        back is not something that could help. Howevr my research showed me that
        looking back can actually help show us the progress we have made, and
        where we came from, in turn cementing the idea that we are all capable
        of growth. I will integrate a growth mindset into my own journey and
        learning plan through the use of reflection, as well as through
        purposeful and dedicated learning. I know now that if I try, if I study
        and 'program' with intent and dedication I can be just as 'smart' as the
        'gifted' people I look up to. I have learned how important a growth
        mindset is to the learning process and I will try hard to employ it
        moving forward. I watched
        <a href="https://youtu.be/r0qpJxEhOP4">this video</a> while researching
        and I found it very engaging and well presented. It discusses how a
        growth mindset affects how a growth mindset can impact companies and
        organisations, rather than indivduals which intrigued me.
