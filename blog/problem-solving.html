      <h4>When I was blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
      <p>
        The first time that I was stuck on a simple problem was in the
        'manipulating objects' kata. I know now that the reason was I simply
        didn't understand how objects worked. However at the time I was stumped.
        The problem solving techniques I used we first breaking it down, I tried
        breaking the problem into small steps, as in 'get up, walk out the door,
        do a barrel roll' small steps. However even working with that I could'nt
        solve the problem, so then I went to the next step, which was to use my
        google brain. I asked google 'JS how to access objects within objects'
        and then read through the results. This taught be the syntax and from
        there I was able to solve the problem. During that problem solving
        process I felt quite preassured. Knowing that I currently wasn't able to
        solve it made me think that I might never solve it, that put a feeling
        of preassure on me which ultimately slowed me down in solving it as it
        discouraged me. That did however leave me coming away from that having
        learned not to get discouraged, because despite my doubts I did solve
        the problem, and it didn't take that long after all (I think that
        problem specifically took me 30 minutes). Having learned that early on
        in the katas it helped me not to feel the same way later on in the
        module.

      <h4>Elegantly solved a problem</h4>
      <p>
        A timer where I elegantly solved a problem was in the FizzBuzz and Super
        FizzBuzz stages. In the problem we had to take a list of number, and
        return the exact same list back, except for any numbers that are
        divisiable by: 15, 5, and 3. We would replace those numbers with
        "FizzBUzz", "Fizz", and "Buzz", before return them. The problem solving
        techniques I used for this stage were pseudocode. I wrote clear
        instructions for myself on how to form the conditional statements and
        functions. I then wrote out my code following those instructions and it
        worked first try. Then following on from this I worked on SuperFizzBuzz,
        in which I used a method called .map() (The .map function applies runs a
        function on each item of an array, or list. It is similar to a loop but
        much simpler to use in the situations where it can be used.) which I had
        researched previously and used it to apply the function I had just
        written to the lists that its tested with. becuase I had uesd clear
        pseudocode in the prevous step I had a very stable function that worked
        well, and it ran again with no issues. coming into this process I
        actually felt nervous. I saw alot of people struggling with the fizzbuzz
        problems, and so that made me nervous. It is also probably why I wrote
        such clear pseudocode. However once I got moving I felt alot more
        confident with it. And I felt proud of my solution at the end. The
        biggest thing I learned from this was the benefit of breaking a problem
        down into small pieces, as well as giving myself clear steps on how to
        solve the problem.

      <h4>Using problem solving techniques</h4>
      <p>
        I am confident using most of the problem solving techniques we have
        discussed and researched. My favourites are pseudocode, trying stuff out
        and the rubber ducky method. However I have used all of the techniques.
        I don't think I used console.logging enough, and I see the value in it
        however I struggled a bit with getting it to work with the test pages. I
        probably googled everything atleast once so I can confidently say I am
        comfortable with that. I also spent alot of time improving my process
        with reflection. All together these techniques together helped me to
        solve the problems efficiently and to the best of my ability.

        One of the times I struggled to ask for help was during that whereAreYou
        problem. I hadn't seen anyone else struggling with it so I felt I should
        be able to solve it. That meant the I took alot of other approaches to
        solving it rather than asking for help when I problably should have. I
        did however ask one of my peers for help in the end, and it was alot of
        help in pointing me in the right direction.
