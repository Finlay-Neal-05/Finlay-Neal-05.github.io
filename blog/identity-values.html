                I know my own values well, as I have spent much time in my life evaluating myself and who I am at my core. I value respect and equity highly, and have a strong sense of right and wrong, sometimes to a flaw. As well as this I value humility and feel that is integral to who I am. In my past I have had my values tested, and have been placed into situations where making the right decision was not a clear course. 
One such time, where I was captured by an ethical decision was during the covid pandemic. At the time I was moving between the houses of my parents, since they live apart. My father has young children and I was forced to decide whether I would go see them and risk bringing infection, or whether I would stay put for the unknown duration of the pandemic lockdown. I weighed up the options, and decided that despite the increased risk that I would continue to visit, knowing that in the event where I might bring the virus with me I would be held responsible. My values of equality and wanting to share my time between my parents overcame the potential risk of the virus. I know now that I made the right decision as missing almost a whole year of my little siblins up bringing is much scarier of an idea than the alternative. 

Another strong impact on my values and identity are the people I surround myself with: Parents, siblins, friends and mentors. They all play a role in how I see the world. My parents taught me about the fairness and equality that I value so highly. My friends and mentors taught me respect, Showing me that everyone is deserving of respect regardless of their place in the world. 

When it comes to learning my strengths are topped by my respect for myself. I know that I am capable of achieving the goals I set for myself, Dev Academy being one of them, And I feel I owe it to myself, thus giving me the drive to not giveup on my goals. 

However. In stark contrast to that I also struggle alot with procrastination. I know that if I start and even do 2 minutes of work i'll be rolling, however sometimes even that is hard to achieve, and I will often procrastinate with tasks like cleaningn the kitchen for the third time today so that I don't feel guilty for procrastinating. This is easily my biggest weakness on the topic and I try hard to work with it. Since starting Dev Academy it has not been a problem for me as I am very passionate about completing this course, However I can imagine over a long period of time willpower won't last. That is why over the course of this project I have set myself the goal of making a habit out of this. (as covered in the prep material). If I can do it once I can do it multiple times, and repeating the practice can, I believe, lead to a much better quality of life. 

Finally, I have had lots of experience in recent years working with others. I often worked on creative projects with a close friend of mine, Video documentation projects, of school events and trips ETC. There were times we faced conflicts in creative expression, And him being much stronger of will than I meant we had to work on our teamwork. The approach we used is a "everyone must be heard" method, and it lead to us hearing everyones ideas and identidying pros and cons, and which would work best in the context of our goals for the project.
