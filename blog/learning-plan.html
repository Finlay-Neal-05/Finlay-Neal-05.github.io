            <!-- comment -->
            <p>

                My long term goal has not changed since foundations, and I am still confident in what I said then. I don't think these goals will help or hinder me muuch during bootcamp, although it may give me something to aim towards. Meanwhile my strengths and weaknesses have improved. Originally my fear of a blank screen no longer applies as over the course of foundations I have learned how to work with that, and I have learned how to majorly improve my procrastination habits. I also, through the use of the time boxes have improved the problem I had where I over worked each project. 
<br>
My biggest non technical challenge would probably still be staying on top of the workload. I do not know how much more intense bootcamp will be, so I will make my best effort to practice the skills we learned in the core material to manage my time well. I would like to work on my time management skills. They seem to be very important and I know that I myself have room for improvement there. I would also like to develop my leadership skills, as it is something I have a strong interest in and I think it is also a good life skill for someone at the earlier end of life like myself, to develop. 
</p><p>
My expectations of the bootcamp team are to teach me, and us, as a group the principles they offer in a way that can be understood. I also expect from them that they will push me to better my habits, such as procrastination, so that I might better my time management, and also get more work done to a higher standard. 
</p><p>
I will seek help in a timely way by first asking google, then a peer, and finally a facilitator of none of the previous attempts prove succesful. I commit to practicing the 2 minute rule with all my work, as well as setting time box goals, and reflecting at the end of each day on what I did and did not achieve. These tools I have been practicing during foundations and they have helped me improve my work workload management massively. They are some of the most valuable things I have learned while doing the foundations core material.

            <ul>
                <li> my long term goal is to work as a full stack developer, and as alot of the people here to have some independence when it comes to how and where I work. I have considered further down the line going to study and learn some other fields, such as cyber security. However my medium term goal is to work as a full stack developer for a few years atleast.</li>
                <li> My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning come arm in arm, often I will find it hard to start something, for example fear of a blank page or screen often sits with me strongly. However to contrast I find once I get started on something that I find it hard to stop, I want to keep working on it, and I probably would until I deem it finished, however that seems like an endless endevour sometimes as I am of the opinion that my work can always be improved.</li>
                <li>Some core human skills that I would like to develop in myself while at Dev Academy include working efficiently with a team, as well as communicating with project managers. I wish to have freedom where and how I work, and that relies heavily on communication with a team or project manager, as face to face and constantly being im the same office all the time wouldn't be as accesible of an option. That being said I don't have much knowledge about that environment and I could be very wrong. All in all I just want to be able to work well in a team, and to manage my time well. Those would be the biggest things for me coming through and out of Dev Academy.</li>
                <li>I will manage myeslf to work productively by executing the time management tools that have been presented so far through foundations. These include using the timebox method, as well as using time tracking tools such as toggl. To work productively with others I will apply any learning that I gain throughout my Dev Academy journey. I will make sure to treat people with respect and to communicate clearly on any topic that is presented to a team.</li>
                <li>When the time comes where I need help, my commitment as to how and where I will find help is to first try and solve it myself, work through the problem and to break it down. When that doesn't work for me, I will then go to my cohort and peers and ask there. If noone has the answer I will then go to the facilitators and mentors and ask there. That is my commitment on how I will seek help in a timely way. </li>
                <li>From the facilitator team I expect that they will guide myself and any others to finding solutions to our problems, as well as creating an environment where each person can act on their own learning plan. Me personally I need facilitators to help me when I get stuck, and this is best done by pointing me in the right direction rather than giving a direct solution, as I know ill forget it if its told to my face. I have noticed that that is how the dev academy facilitators already help in the tech support channel so that works well for me. </li>
                <li>I have little scheduling commitments as I am young and dont have many family commitments, so that won't become a problem for me.</li>
